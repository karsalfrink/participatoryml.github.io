45,Can Algorithms Help Support Participatory Housing?,Rediet Abebe (Harvard University); Daniel Wu (Immuta),Research track,Position paper,Applications,any,am,,,,,,"Social scientists argue that the US may be in the worst housing crisis in decades, with millions of families experiencing homelessness and housing instability each year. Amid this housing crisis, participatory housing systems – such as Community Land Trusts (CLTs) – have emerged as alternative models to expand housing opportunities for families with fewer socioeconomic means.

In this position paper, we examine what role algorithms and platforms can and have played to support efforts for participatory housing. We highlight examples ranging from supporting diverse coalition building to providing a framework for implementing participatory budgeting to identifying opportunities to drive down prohibitive costs. We highlight existing and new opportunities from a perspective that acknowledges and asserts the secondary role that algorithms can and should play in this domain. We close with a discussion on the benefits and harms of algorithmic tools for housing."

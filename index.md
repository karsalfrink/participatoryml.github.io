title: Participatory Approaches to Machine Learning
subtitle: ICML 2020 Workshop (July 17 or 18)
---

## Overview

The designers of a machine learning (ML) system typically have far more
power over the system than the individuals who are ultimately impacted
by the system and its decisions. Recommender platforms shape the users’
preferences; the individuals classified by a model often do not have
means to contest a decision; and the data required by ML systems
necessitates that the privacy of many yield to the design choices of a
few.

Many sub-fields of ML are concerned with incorporating user feedback and
preferences, including human-in-the-loop learning, mechanism design, and
recommender systems. However, these sub-fields usually involve humans
with the goal of better optimizing a centrally imposed objective. In
response, our workshop aims to explore methods that, by design, enable
and encourage the perspectives of those impacted by an ML system to
shape the system and its decisions. We thus invite ML researchers to
consider approaches for designing more *democratic, cooperative, and
participatory ML systems.*

Whereas several past workshops have been broadly concerned with societal
issues of AI deployment, this workshop has a clearer technical goal: to
address the power differentials embedded in ML systems. By involving
affected populations in shaping the goals of the overall system, we hope
to move beyond just tools for enabling human participation to a redesign
of power dynamics.

A recent interest in algorithmic fairness and human-centred ML indicates
a strong interest among ML researchers in problems of fairness, equity,
and justice. However, these fields often focus on *centralized*
solutions, lending increasing power to system designers and deployers,
and less to users and affected populations. In response to the growing
social science critique of the power imbalance present in the research,
design, and deployment of ML systems, we wish to consider *a new set of
technical formulations for the ML community* on the subject of more
democratic, cooperative, and participatory ML systems.

### Topics

We hope to encourage progress in the following topics:

-   **Recourse and reachability**: Creating systems that ensure the user
    has the potential to adapt their predictions or recommendations
    (Ustun, Spangher, and Liu 2019; Dean, Rich, and Recht 2020).

-   **Richer interactive ML:** Incorporating richer user feedback into
    ML systems. Limitations of current methods in fully capturing a
    user’s ‘preferences’ (Schnabel, Bennett, and Joachims 2018; Yang et
    al. 2019)

-   **Mechanism design or computational social choice and learning**:
    designs that incorporate preference elicitation in allocative ML
    systems, such as adaptive experimentation or learning-based
    algorithmic governance (Narita 2019; M. K. Lee et al. 2019; Kahng et
    al. 2019).

-   **Collective and participatory design applied to community
    involvement in ML:** Qualitative and quantitative methods and
    frameworks aimed at giving a voice to communities affected by ML
    systems. Tools for collective training processes and collective
    design of ML systems (Katell et al. 2020; Brown et al. 2019;
    Halfaker and Geiger 2019; Patton et al. 2020).

-   **Deferral and/or abstention**: Classification frameworks which
    incorporate deferral to humans, or at least a non-classification
    outcome. (Madras, Pitassi, and Zemel 2018; El-Yaniv and
    Wiener 2010).

-   **Documentation & audit methods:** Work which is intended to inform
    and engage users in model design, development or deployment
    processes and its limitations (Mitchell et al. 2019; Ali et
    al. 2019).

-   **Contestation:** Technological methods and tools for
    analyzing/protesting/contesting the outcomes of ML systems in the
    absence of centralized cooperation  (Kulynych et al. 2020; Nasr and
    Tschantz 2020; Ali et al. 2019).

-   **Tools that support community and worker organization** (Matias and
    Mou 2018; Irani and Silberman 2013; Salehi et al. 2015).

## The Coronavirus Situation

Being collocated with ICML, the workshop is planned to take place in Vienna, Austria, in July 2020. Due to the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely that the conference and the workshop will be held either virtually, or be postponed. See [the official ICML website](https://icml.cc/) for any news.

## Call for Papers

The workshop will include contributed papers. All accepted papers will be allocated either a poster presentation, or a 25-minute talk slot. We will publish non-archival proceedings.

We invite submissions of full papers, works-in-progress, and position papers. We expect that all papers introduce novel ideas or results: we will not accept works that have already been published.

Papers should have up to 4 pages (excluding references, acknowledgements, or appendices), and be formatted using the ICML submission template. Papers should be anonymized.

Submission website: TBD
